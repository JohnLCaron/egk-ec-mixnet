# Egk Mixnet

_last update 12/27/2023_

Preliminary explorations of mixnet implementations to be used with the ElectionGuard Kotlin library.

We use the the ElectionGuard Kotlin library for all the cryptography primitives. This library closely follows the ElectionGuard 2.0 specification.

Most of the prototype code in egk-mixlib is a port of code found in the OpenCHVote repository.
