# Egk Mixnet

_last update 02.08.2024_

(Work in Progress)

Preliminary explorations of mixnet implementations to be used with the ElectionGuard Kotlin library. 
Besides being a port to modern Kotlin, the code has been made parallel using kotlin coroutines.
Preliminary measurements show a 3x - 8x speedup vs verificatum.
